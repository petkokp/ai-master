      "Title: After getting my bachelors how long does it take to get a doctorate?\n",
      "Body: Education & Reference Higher Education (University +)After getting my bachelors how long does it take to get a doctorate? In my last year of my bachelors degree in psychology and I want to get a doctorate. But I have no idea how long it would take. And is it better to get a masters a doctorate? Follow 6 answers Answers Relevance Rating Newest Oldest Best Answer: It generally takes 2 years to complete a master's and after that I would say at least 3-4 to complete a Ph. D. although many doctorates take much longer than that: sometimes up to 6-8 years. Unless you're trying to get into a unique medical field, such as virology or epidemiology etc., or to work/teach at the college level, then a master's degree will suffice for the most part. In fact, some colleges employ professors who hold a Masters degree and don't have a doctorate. also fyi, for every 100 Ph. D.'s rewarded to a person, there are fewer than 10 collegiate job openings :). Hope that helped :)dvd_clapp Â· 10 years ago0 1 Comment Asker's rating Many universities allow BA/BS holders to matriculate directly into a doctoral program. Watch out though, some offer the Ph D, while others have the Psy D. The credential is different. The former is more theoretical and research oriented, while the latter is more clinical. I used to work at a college that had AAS and BA degrees. We enrolled students into the AAS, then graduated them and enrolled them into the BA. The AAS was not enough to get a job in the field. They got out of synch really fast. My story here is not for grad school, but honestly, the same principle applies. When you are considering ang graduate degree, take the time to really discuss your plans and goals with not only the admissions person, but the faculty and department chair. They wiill be able to guide you best. Good luck with your search for information. Anonymous Â· 10 years ago0 0 Comment It takes anywhere from four to eight years. I got mine in four years. You usually have two to three years of classes, a written exam after the second year (mine was two days long), an oral exam after the third year and then you write your dissertation. The dissertation is the big unknown. I wrote mine in two years, but I know people who took much longer. If you are doing clinical psychology, it could take longer, because you may need to do clinical training. Someone suggested getting a Master's first. I do not recommend this unless you can't get into a good program. The better schools do not accept terminal master's students. Source (s): University Professor Ranto Â· 10 years ago0 0 Comment I would recommend getting a Masters first, then doctorate. I have my Masters in Education and it took me less than two years. It was just a bunch of classes and a thesis. For a doctorate you have to have a research plan and more classes and tons of work and the Masters will really prepare you for the hard work that earning a doctorate entails. Good luck!Maddog Mommy Â· 10 years ago0 1 Comment It depends on so many things, like what your research is going to be on and how picky your advisors are. 4-6 years is about normal. Secondly, a doctorate is for people who want to be scholars and actively research for the rest of their careers. masters is less research oriented, and is better suited for people who want \"real world\" hands on experience rather than just doing academic research. Good luck. You could probably contact the schools that you are applying to and ask them how long thier students take on average to complete the degrees. Each school will be different.

In 2014, this occurs on Sunday, March 9th.Fall Back: The clocks are set back one hour during Fall Back. In 2014, this occurs on Sunday, November 2nd.What is Daylight Savings?Daylight Savings Time, or DST, in 2014 begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. In March, clocks are moved forward one hour from 2am standard time to 3am DST, and in November, clocks are moved back one hour from 2am DST to 1am standard time. The phrase \"spring forward, fall back\" is a helpful reminder of these time changes.12 Calendar BuilderFULL YEARMONTHAmerican HolidaysAustralian HolidaysCanadian HolidaysChinese HolidaysUK HolidaysBuddhist HolidaysChristian HolidaysHindu HolidaysJewish HolidaysMuslim HolidaysIndian HolidaysGerman HolidaysNew Zealand HolidaysMalaysia HolidaysFrench HolidaysMexican HolidaysEmail RemindersAmerican HolidaysAustralian HolidaysCanadian HolidaysChinese HolidaysUK HolidaysBuddhist HolidaysChristian HolidaysHindu HolidaysJewish HolidaysMuslim HolidaysIndian HolidaysGerman HolidaysNew Zealand HolidaysMalaysia HolidaysFrench HolidaysMexican HolidaysWhen are other Important Days in 2014?Christmas In July 2014Half Christmas 2014Daylight Savings 2014Earth Day 2014New Years 2014Arbor Day 2014World Water Day 2014Summer Solstice 2014Full Moon 2014National Ugly Christmas Sweater Day 2014Winter Solstice 2014International Talk Like A Pirate Day 2014International Bacon Day 2014World Water Day 2014Harvest Moon 2014Blood Moon 2014National Grandparents Day 2014National Dog Day 2014Folsom Street Fair 2014National Day of Prayer 2014Boss' Day 2014National Cat Day 2014National Boyfriend Day 2014Sweetest Day 2014Constitution Day 2014Son and Daughter Day 2014Nobel Prizes 2014International Beer Day 2014London Fashion Week 2014New York Fashion Week 2014Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 201412 What Do You Think About Daylight Savings 2014?Nickname:*Kizin says: November 6, 2014In Arizona, we don't recognize Daylight Savings Time...just like we don't recognize the entire US Constitution. You see, in Arizona, we don't even want time to change at all. It would be best if the Confederates had won the war.Anonymous1207 says: November 2, 2014I disagree with all of you. Daylight savings time has been in this country since Benjamin Franklin and is in an odd way, a historical monument to his life and the things he did for the country. If we do away with this, what else from that time era, or even before then, do you think the government will try to do away with?? There is no \"more perfect union\" to be found in we, the people of today. You're all to busy complaining about your lives and how inconvinient one simple adjustment is twice a year -.- I used to be proud to be an American. Then I realized how many others have lost their own sense of national pride. Shooting fire works once a year doesn't make you a patriot. And complaining about an idea brought upon by one of our founding fathers, an idea that -whether you realize it or not - has played a role in shaping our history seems more of a government ploy of today to try to erase our history from our youth so we no longer question them. Never before in the history of the United States of America have the people let the government get away with so much. And now you all are playing right into their hands. Good job, America. Good job -.-farmery#1 says: October 29, 2014Farmers don't care what time it is; we don't work in an office. Get up with the sun.Eryk says: October 26, 2014I believe that DST is pointless. It is an idea whose time has come and gone. Shifting the clocks doesn't save anything. All it does is disrupt everyone's life twice a year. People, farmers included, are quite capable of adjusting their schedules as needed without any help from the government. Standard time year round would work just fine for me.Realfarmer says: October 24, 2014They didn't start dst for farmers, we get up with the sun and work way after dark so don't blame us.Beth Garrett says: October 20, 2014I think we should NOT have daylight savings time. I think there are problems for school children and for drivers who don't get enough sleep when the change is made in the spring. Also, when daylight is later in the evening, it is hard for people to get settled down and get to bed - especially school children. I don't think the savings warrant it.Maggie May says: October 19, 2014Just change it permanently thirty minutes...then you can be thirty minutes glad or thirty minutes sad if we can't stay on Standard Time.Nursey says: October 5, 2014I work with people who don't understand time. It is hard to adjust their meals, bedtimes etc. I don't care which way they go just don't change my clock twice a year!!GADAVE says: October 2, 2014Enough already....time to do away with DST.Rumpus says: September 28, 2014Get rid of DST, keep standard time. DST is just another way of trying to fool oneself that by doing so we are saving something. When lies are repeated over and over again then it will be accepted as truth. Do we want to make this \"The American Way\"?Grammy says: September 22, 2014It is no longer necessary we should split the time in half, turn the clocks back 1/2 hour in nov and then never have to change them again!! I lived in Arizona for 6 years we did not change the clocks! I do not like having my kids go to school in the dark nor do I like them coming home in the dark there are to many crazies out there, the 1/2 hour (then never change again) would remedy some of the problem as it would be light both in the morning and the evening!instead of pitch black at one or the other due to time changes!farmerkings says: September 19, 2014Yes it is for farming that's why we have itmvm says: September 18, 2014It is outdated, and unnecessary... keep the time the same all year long.Savannah says: September 4, 2014I din't like it. It is not logical and should be done away with. i agree with a previous comment about changing our lives and not the clocks, but I also don't understand why we don't just add an extra two hours to our work days and have three day weekends, an extra two hours is nothing compared to having to drag out of bed, get dressed, take children to daycafre, fight morning traffic just because we are stuck in the 18th century. It's the 21st century and progress is nowhere to be seen.Stick with Standard says: August 25, 2014Daylight Saving Time is ridiculous. It's an outdated, unnecessary tribute to government meddling in yet another part of our lives. Nobody should be 'forced' to adjust sleep or work habits to adapt twice a year to an archaic tradition. Leave it on Standard and leave it alone.Bumpus says: July 24, 2014I LOVE spring forward but HATE fall back. I guess you can't have one without the other, though.Finnoah says: May 26, 2014I live in Arizona so this doesn't affect me except that my parents live on the East coast and during the summer months as I'm getting off work, they're going to bed so sometimes I catch them sleep talking to me. (:Rainesy. says: April 4, 2014I HATE IT, NORMAL PEOPLE LIKE NORMAL TIME.Azriel says: March 9, 2014Hate it. It does nothing good for the people and only screws up their biological clock and also more people are fired for being late to work during this time period.In Arizona, they do not do the daylight savings time switch. Smart move I say. Too bad for the rest of us.wakeup says: March 9, 2014Society as a whole saves a lot with daylight savings. A city, county, state, nation saves enormous amounts in electricity costs in the morning and at night. Stop complaining and be more adaptable. It's the key to survival.hatesdst says: March 9, 2014I hate DST. Why can't the will of US citizens determine if we have DST.Brombsby says: March 7, 2014Just to be clear it is not \"Savings\" but \"Saving\". \"Savings\" is what you get at your local grocery store!HAMBONE says: March 7, 2014SILLY I LIKE SUNPet lover says: March 7, 2014I believe it is for farming purposes#Mickey Mouse says: March 7, 2014I don't like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!hmm says: March 6, 2014We set up one hour on Saturday at 2 am rightjojo says: March 5, 2014yes i'm with jimntherock move 30 min then leave it aloneret4lif says: March 5, 2014I absolute hate it. Its like being in jet lag for 9 months. It takes me several months to get kinda adjusted to DST. Study's show that it doesn't accomplish anything least of all energy usage. I still turn my lights on at about the same time even in DST. So where is the savings. I would like to just go to normal time and stay there. We would save so much in lost productivity, health, and probably energy.Lisa says: March 3, 2014Love iteab says: March 2, 2014Just pick one and leave it alone!Amieux says: March 1, 2014Why can't we just leave the clocks on Standard Time and adjust our lives accordingly? Changing the clocks is an idea that has seen it's day. Time for a change, America!!!!!!!!!!!! Let's Standardize!!!!!!peaceful says: February 26, 2014I think it is a bad idea, just leave the time the same all year we have enough disturbances to deal with and now they are starting earlier and ending later...do not like it at alltired says: February 25, 2014Like the old Indian said \"only the government would think that by cutting one foot off a blanket and sewing it on the other end that you'd get a longer blanket\". How true.mndy says: February 25, 2014It is bad for the health, I detest it. It should be brought back like years ago when we had to vote for it.Canada says: February 25, 2014need to leave DS alone. no more changing clocks it bothersome and annoyingdeb says: February 24, 2014It is to give us daylight later in the summer. Does it really benefit anyone?? Kids have to go to bed in the daylight. Farmers still have the same hours of light. Probably not much benefit to anyone.Woody says: February 24, 2014Leave the clocks on daylight savings time all year around, don't fall back for the winter, it is better to stay light as long a possible throughout the whole year.Moderntimesdoesn't needthis. says: February 15, 2014I moved to Indiana for my four years of college - and there was no changing of the clocks. I loved it! It made so much sense and was so easy. Then I moved back to the East coast. Daylight savings in just wrong.Marty says: February 8, 2014I see absolutely no reason for having to change the clock twice a year. No one gains a thing.ms.angelize says: January 3, 2014JUST LET IT BE!!!! Would Love for the sun to still be up when you get off work, it is rejuvenating !!! Please leave the time alone...Darla says: December 19, 2013I got in car accident because of it . Loosing an hrs makes a huge difference. It takes me weeks to ajust. Its stupid and it suckstoofoo says: November 2, 2013I don't know too many fans of daylight savings. I vote that we abolish it and stay on the same time year around.Texasgardner says: October 31, 2013I love daylight saving time, even as a retired person. On standard time, it is dark by 6:00 p.m. and you feel like it's time to go to bed. It makes it more difficult to go shopping in the dark. I feel safer going to stores during the daylight hours. I wish Texas would stay on daylight saving time year round. In south Texas, we have very few days that are cold and it's great to have those extra evening hours to be out. I think I'm going to leave my clocks on daylight saving time this winter and just subtract one hour when looking at them. I don't go to that many places with a set time anyway.jimntherock says: October 5, 2013I wish we could just settle for a 30 minute adjustment one time and forget it from there.DrivesMeNuts says: October 4, 2013DST is not only unnecessary, it reaks havoc on health, and is also costly when you analyze it. It should be stopped; who is making money off of it so as to keep saying we must have it?Yoda says: October 1, 2013Matters, it does not, early or late... Golfer seeks evening sun, he does... Upon early light, others depend... Golfer, selfish he is...  An equilibrium benefits both, in compromise... Like the Force, overwhelming one cannot be...Golfer needs daylight in winter says: September 8, 2013I wish we could leave the time alone. Set it to where it never gets dark before 7:00 in the winter which would be leave it like it is now. Never fall back. Then leave it alone.. The only reason we do this is for daylight in the morning. We do not need daylight in the morning, we are just going to school or work what does it matter if it don't get light out until 8 or 9 am.LadyDi says: March 3, 2013Absolutely ridiculous! My body clock is much harder to reset than my digital clocks. Why can't we just leave the clocks alone? If people want a different summer schedule, change your work hours.\n",
